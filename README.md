pixel-boiler
============

A pixel art and sprite sheet editor for retro graphic games

What is its purpose?
-------------------
* Well, first of all it should be a working editor which I can use in my other projects.
* It's proof of concept for multi-platform app development based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So far it works as a standard web app and as a Windows 8 app. It should be easly to adapt it to work as chrome packaged app. iOS and Android versions are also possible.
* And it's a test how architecture concepts (MVC, entity systems) can be implemented in real live applications

How can I test it?
------------------
The easiest way is to run it as a web app:
* Clone the repository
* Start a web server (I recommend [serve](https://npmjs.org/package/serve) for NodeJS)
* Open the ``web.html`` in your browser (``http://localhost:3000/web.html`` if you are using serve)
