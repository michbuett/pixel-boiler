pixel-boiler
============

A pixel art and sprite sheet editor for retro graphic games

What is its purpose?
-------------------
* Well, first of all it should be a working editor which I can use in my other projects.
* It's proof of concept for multi-platform app development based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So far it works as a standard web app and as a desktop appliction for Windows, Linux and Mac. Future release may include versions for iOS, Android and Windows UWP.
* And it's a more complex example how to build apps using entity component systems and reactive programming techniques.
